Border Collies are often used as herding dogs on farms and ranches, but they also make wonderful companions for active families. Did you know that they are one of the most popular breeds in the world?<|eot_id|>"

The image you provided appears to be a photo of a white dog with curly fur, but it's not clear what breed it is. Can you please provide a clearer or more detailed photo of the dog so I can better identify it?<|eot_id|>"
